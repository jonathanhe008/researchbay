## About Frontend

This repository contains the code and documentation for Research Bay's web frontend, which handles all UI layer user data and actions for Research Bay. This application was built with React.js (bootstraped with create-react-app) and Redux and uses Research Bay's backend API. The website is currently hosted using Firebase Hosting.

More information about Research Bay as an entire project is available at the [main repository](https://github.com/DSC-UIUC/research-bay).
