# Research Bay

### 4/29/20 Release Version

This directory contains Research Bay's code from 4/29/20, the day that it was submitted to the 2020 DSC Solution Challenge. Therefore, this code is meant to serve as a snapshot of all of Research Bay's components and not intended to be used for current/ongoing local development (although you can).

To locally run and setup Research Bay's most recent code, please use this [detailed guide](https://github.com/DSC-UIUC/research-bay#getting-started) and use the code from the following repositories:

* [Frontend](https://github.com/DSC-UIUC/rbay-frontend)
* [Backend](https://github.com/DSC-UIUC/rbay-backend)
* [Data/ML](https://github.com/DSC-UIUC/rbay-data-ml) (for our recommendation and search systems and other experimental features)
