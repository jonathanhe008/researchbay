I am an undergraduate at the University of Illinois pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

On a journey to combine my passions for healthcare and process improvement, my focus is on global healthcare optimization and how to create the best experience possible for all patients, especially those in under privileged situations.

I am currently interested in a wide array of internship positions such as management consulting in healthcare, strategy and technology consulting, data analytics, project management, healthcare administration, global healthcare analyst, service towards the disabled community, or operations. I am looking to get an understanding of what different paths entail to plan ahead, and try new opportunities!

Commitment to leadership and being influential in a community are both very important to me. Through research, volunteering, a full-ride merit scholarship student and holding a variety of executive positions on campus, I hope to improve and challenge myself, to be introduced to new perspectives, to gain rewarding experiences and exposure, and to help make wherever I am a little better for a lot of people.

I love traveling, photography, creating videos, writing, learning new languages and cultures, and trying new food. I've also been learning dance for 14 years now and consider it my biggest companion and comfort!

Hey there. I am a third-year student studying Computer Science at UC Irvine who loves to find new and creative ways to solve problems and plan to use that passion to develop in the technology industry once I finish school.

I am always looking for Tech Conferences, Networking Events, or any other professional experience with software development! Feel free to shoot me a message or reach out at dmuonekw@uci.edu!

Junior Computer Science student at the University of Michigan

When I was 14, I went to a journalism camp and ruled out journalism as a possible career forever.
When I was 15, I volunteered at a hospital and ruled out medicine as my future.
When I was 16, I interned at a startup and decided that software engineering was actually... fun?

That was it, that was when I went ahead with studying Computer Science. Every project I work on is an emotional roller coaster which is why I enjoy it because it keeps me engaged. The best moments are when I fall asleep thinking of bugs in my code and wake up with a possible solutions.

Back in 6th grade, we were shown a horrifying and overly dramatic documentary about how the world is going to die and no birds will sing in 70 years. Upon calculation, I realized that I might still be alive then. This earth shattering conclusion set me down a dark windy road that I'm still trying to figure out.

You see, what I've realized is that I love my work but I'm not satisfied until it's making a tangible impact on what I care about. I know what I want to do and I know what impact I want to cause, I'm just trying to find the link between those nodes.

The good thing is that I'm enjoying the journey to self discovery. Everyday offers the possibility of learning something new, meeting someone from a different background, and allowing myself to be inspired by someone else's story. In short, people excite me. I thrive off of everyone else's energy. And the road doesn't seem scary at all once you've got some optimism and energy as your allies.
